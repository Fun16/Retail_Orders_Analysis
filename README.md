# Retail_Orders_Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python and SQL. We leverage the Kaggle API to download the dataset, perform data processing and cleaning using pandas, load the cleaned data into a SQL server, and finally answer some interesting questions using SQL. This project showcases the power of combining Python and SQL for effective data analytics.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Download**: Using the Kaggle API, we download the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Processing and Cleaning**: We use pandas to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
3. **Data Loading**: The cleaned data is loaded into a SQL server for further analysis.
4. **SQL Analysis**: We write SQL queries to answer key questions and extract valuable insights from the dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- SQLAlchemy
- Kaggle API
- A SQL server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
